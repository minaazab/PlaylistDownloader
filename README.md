# PlaylistDownloader
A python program that allows for easy downloading of Spotify songs and YouTube playlists.


playlist.py allows you to download a full YouTube playlist (or a range of songs from a playlist). 

singleSong.py allows you to download any Spotify song into a folder of your choice.

Disclaimer! I do not advise downloading any music from Spotify using this program. This was simply a program to explore python and a few libraries. Do not download any playlists from Youtube unless you own the playlist and all of the videos in said playlist. Make sure to abide by Spotify and YouTube's terms of service.
